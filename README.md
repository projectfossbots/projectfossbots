### "Because the people of the GNU and FOSS communities should enjoy Chatbots too!"

Hey there!
I make high-quality and completely free and open-source Chatbots on Character.AI and Janitor.AI, where anyone can use, modify, fork (copy), etc them as long as they credit me.

If you want to make a takedown or chatbot request, ask questions, etc then please email me at ``` fossbotsproject@tuta.com ```.

As of writing this (June 3rd, 2024) I currently have 16 Chatbots released to the public, and more to come in the future.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy my Chatbots (and their source code)!
